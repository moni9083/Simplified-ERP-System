# Simplified ERP System with React

Simplified ERP System with React
This project is a simplified interface for an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system, aimed at efficiently managing basic business operations. It consists of three main pages: Dashboard, Products Management, and Orders Management. The project utilizes React for building modular components, managing application state, and React Router for navigation between different sections.

# Features

## Dashboard
The dashboard serves as the main landing page of the ERP system, offering a concise overview of essential metrics and features. Here's a breakdown of its components:
   - Navigation Links or Buttons: To streamline user experience and facilitate seamless navigation within the ERP system, the dashboard includes links or buttons that allow users to quickly access the Products and Orders management pages. These navigation elements ensure that users can easily transition to different sections of the system to perform specific tasks without any hassle.
## Products Management
The Products Management section of the ERP system enables users to efficiently handle product-related tasks. Here's an overview of its functionalities:
   - Product Listing: This section presents a comprehensive list of products available in the system. Each product entry includes essential details such as its name, category, price, and stock quantity. Users can quickly scan through the list to gain insights into the product inventory and its attributes.
   - Add, Edit, and Delete Products: Users have the ability to perform various actions on the products, including adding new products, editing existing ones to update their details (e.g., price, stock quantity, category), and deleting products that are no longer needed. These functionalities empower users to manage the product catalog effectively, ensuring its accuracy and relevance.
## Orders Management
The Orders Management page is dedicated to handling all        aspects related to orders within the ERP system. Here's what it encompasses:
   - Order Listing: This section displays a comprehensive list of orders received by the business. Each order entry includes pertinent details such as the order ID, customer name, order date, and status (e.g., pending, processing, shipped). Users can easily review the list to track the status of orders and manage them efficiently.
  - Order Status Updates: Users may have the option to update the status of orders as they progress through various stages (e.g., from processing to shipped). This feature ensures transparency and enables effective communication with customers regarding the status of their orders.

Overall, the Products and Orders management sections provide users with the necessary tools and functionalities to streamline business operations, manage inventory effectively, and ensure a seamless order fulfillment process within the ERP system.
# Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: A routing library for React, enabling navigation between different pages/components.
- HTML: HyperText Markup Language for structuring web pages.
- Inline styles With React: Inline styles with React for the styling of this project. Inline styles allow us to apply styles directly to the components using JavaScript objects, providing a more scoped and modular approach to styling within the component itself.
